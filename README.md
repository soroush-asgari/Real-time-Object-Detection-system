# Real-time-Object-Detection-system

In this project, pretrained weights of models "YOLO5" and 'VGG16' were used to detect objects live.

Webcam is used to capture frames as input of model and models detect object(s) in each frame.

"VGG16" can only detect one object per frame, but "YOLO5" is able to detect 5 object simultaneously in each frame.

Also all detected objects highlighted by a square in the live webcam window with its probability.
